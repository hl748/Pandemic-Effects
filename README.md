# Pandemic-Effects

### Project description
The COVID-19 global pandemic has changed every industry, probably permanently. Marketing is out front when it comes to uncertainty across all industries. For example, small business owner who runs liquor store might not want to promote "CORONA" beer this year like the owner did last year. Our dashboard allows the user to search for a keyword and compare the news landscape before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will answer a question such as *"How the headline words have changed in news articles pre and post 
the COVID-19 outbreak?”*
